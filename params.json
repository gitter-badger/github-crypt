{"name":"github-crypt","tagline":"Asymmetric message cryptography via GitHub SSH keys","body":"Takes advantage of the fact that GitHub makes users public SSH keys publicly available\r\n(e.g. [rockymadden](https://github.com/rockymadden.keys)). We can convert said public keys to PKCS8\r\npems to encrypt files. Encrypted files can then only be decrypted with the corresponding private\r\nkey.\r\n\r\n#### Example Workflow:\r\n\r\n* You execute `github-crypt encrypt` against a GitHub user's public key\r\n* You send the encrypted file(s) to this user\r\n* They execute `github-crypt decrypt`, using their private key to decrypt\r\n\r\n#### Maximum Message Length:\r\n\r\nBe aware, a maximum message length exists which depends upon the key size:\r\n\r\n| Key Size (bits) | Maximum Message Length (bytes)\r\n| --------------- | ------------------------------\r\n| 768             | 85\r\n| 1024            | 117\r\n| 2048            | 246\r\n| 4096            | 502\r\n| 8192            | 1018\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n```bash\r\n$ brew tap rockymadden/rockymadden\r\n$ brew install github-crypt\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ github-crypt --help\r\nUsage:\r\n  github-crypt bits [username] [--username|-u <username>] [--index|-i <index>]\r\n  github-crypt decrypt [file] [--file|-f <file>] [--key|-k <key>]\r\n  github-crypt encrypt [file] [--file|-f <file>] [--username|-u <username>] [--index|-i <index>] [--upload|-U]\r\n  github-crypt keys [username] [--username|-u <username>] [--index|-i <index>]\r\n\r\nDiscovery Commands:\r\n  bits     Output GitHub public key(s) bit-length\r\n  keys     Output GitHub public key(s)\r\n\r\nCrypto Commands:\r\n  encrypt     Encrypt a file with a GitHub public key; only the corresponding private key can decrypt\r\n  decrypt     Decrypt a file with the private key corresponding to the GitHub public key used to encrypt\r\n```\r\n\r\n> __NOTE:__ All subcommands prompt for required arguments which were not provided via options. This\r\nallows for both traditional option-based usage and also interactive/prompt-based usage.\r\n\r\n### Encrypt file (as user `A`):\r\n```bash\r\n$ github-crypt encrypt\r\nEnter file path: file.txt\r\nEnter GitHub username: userb\r\nEncrypting: done\r\n\r\n$ github-crypt encrypt file.txt\r\nEnter GitHub username: userb\r\nEncrypting: done\r\n\r\n$ github-crypt encrypt file.txt --username=userb\r\nEncrypting: done\r\n```\r\n\r\n> __NOTE:__ Encrypted file `file.txt.enc` is created.\r\n\r\n### Decrypt file (as user `B`):\r\n```bash\r\n$ github-crypt decrypt\r\nEnter file path: file.txt.enc\r\nDecrypting: done\r\n\r\n$ github-crypt decrypt file.txt.enc\r\nDecrypting: done\r\n```\r\n\r\n> __NOTE:__ Decrypted file `file.txt` is created.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n```\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2015 Rocky Madden (https://rockymadden.com/)\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
